My sites primary purpose is to exhibit the web dev code I have implemented.

My target audience are my teachers, other students in my cohort and friends interested to learn about web development.

I would like users to interact with my site by finding it easy to glean the content and by finding it easy to navigate.

To achieve the desired user experience I will include responsiveness and design the layout such that the text is readable, well spaced out and supported with design elements such as boxes.
